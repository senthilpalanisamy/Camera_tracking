Incase of any doubts with XCAP and XCLLIB, 
Useful sections to read in the PIXCI Manual would be 4 and 5 for XCAP and
6 for XCLIB

The weekly progress pdf was not meant to be a documentation of the system 
built but as a mechanism to set goals for every week and communicate the progress
for every week. Neverthless, I found this to be a value source of information
on the how the system and our objectives have evolved over time. So it might
be a good place to skim through if you want to get a feel for what the work is
like. All lab members should have access to the original ppt online. They 
should be able to access, view and share the ppt if needed
