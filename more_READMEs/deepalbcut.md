1. I have a virtual environment setup for deeplabcut. In order to use it,
   type the command "workon deeplabcut"
2. If you are using a new system, use the requirements.txt to install all the
   python dependencies. wx_python is an annoying depedency, which is hard to 
   install sometimes. If installing these libraries seems like too much pain 
   to take, consider using their docker container (their github website 
   for further reference - https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut)
3. For details on how to train a model, follow the instructions specified in 
   the two video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xwOhUcIGio&t=5s)
